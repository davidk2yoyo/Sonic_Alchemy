- ✅ `POST /api/v1/lyrics/generate` - Generate lyrics
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/canvas/upload` - Upload image

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If an endpoint returns error 500:
- Verify you're authenticated (valid token)
- Check backend logs
- Verify Docker services are running

### If you can't upload files:
- Verify MinIO is running: `docker-compose ps`
- Verify the file is in the correct format
- Verify the file size doesn't exceed the limit (50MB)

### If Gemini doesn't work:
- Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is configured in `.env`
- Verify you haven't exceeded the API quota

## 📝 Notes

- All endpoints require authentication (except login/register)
- Files are stored in MinIO
- Image and audio processing may take time
- Results are saved in PostgreSQL database
